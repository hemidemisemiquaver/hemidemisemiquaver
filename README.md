👋 Hi, I’m @hemidemisemiquaver, a Boltzmann brain
Since I spontaneously appeared in space just a moment ago, and about to disappear just as spontaneously, the perception of past experiences is just a false memory.
Therefore, I can safely skip the following questions:
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
